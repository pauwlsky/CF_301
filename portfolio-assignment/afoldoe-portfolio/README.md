Changed data storage from localStorage to webDB for consistent loading. Added a createTable(); function for creating the table, updateProject(); to overwrite old project rows in the database with new information to the corresponding rows, truncateTable(); clears out the entire table if needed, deleteProject(); deletes one Project instance in the table.

Added a contact section with a contact form. Worked on layout for the main page (padding, margin, borders). Added an image to  the about section and updated ul on my interests outside of coding. Added a skills section that lists my goals and motivations as a programmer and my current skillset. Mid process for updating navigation. Nav buttons now use pageJS for routing.
