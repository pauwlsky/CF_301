     "body": "<p>The first website I finished outside a tutorial! My classmate, Sean, and I created a sample website for a nonprofit bike shop. I took on the styling for the page, including implementing a form template we found appealing. The fuctonality pertaining to the bike shop section was also my work. I created a simple pop up div to show more detailed information on the bikes for sale. As most nonprofit bike shops in Portland accept bike donations, I included a form to collect user input on the bike and its details they would like to donate along with their contact informaton.</p>"
